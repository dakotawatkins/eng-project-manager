### Installation

Clone/Fork repo. `git clone (GITHUB LINK)`.
Run `git init` to initialize project as a repo if not already a repo.
\*\* Have main `eng-project-manager` directory be the ONLY repo (don't create repo's in front-end/back-end folders also).

Go into individual front-end/back-end folders to install to run `npm install` to each folder, see those README.md files for instruction.

Run `npm start` in either front-end or back-end folder to start the apps front-end or back-end.

### Github

`git init` creates repo in current directory.
`git add .` addes ALL updated files to be commited.
`git commit -m "ex: initial commit"` commits changes.
`git remote add origin https://github.com/dako....end-proj...git` attaches repo to github repo.
`git push -u origin main` pushes `main` branch to `origin` url (github).

`git status` shows status of repository. Shows a list of files that are changes, or added, or nothing if commited.
`git remote -v` shows a list of urls the repo is using.
